# HTML5

This repository contains various **frontend projects** I’m building to practice and apply what I’ve learned from the **Bro Code HTML5 & CSS tutorials**. Each project helps me reinforce core HTML5 concepts by creating real-world examples.

## About

Following Bro Code’s easy-to-understand lessons, I’m developing small projects that cover:

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Forms and input handling
- Multimedia embedding
- Responsive design basics
- Accessibility improvements

This hands-on approach helps me gain confidence and deepen my understanding of modern frontend development.
Instead of updating my journey of learning each and every small detail, like most of my repositories, i am going to apply it all in one or two projects as a proof to myself that i am aware of the basics of HTML5.
