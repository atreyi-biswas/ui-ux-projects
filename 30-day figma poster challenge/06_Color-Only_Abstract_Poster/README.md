## 🎯 Objective  
The aim was to create a poster using **only colour** — without text, icons, or imagery — to express emotion, energy, and balance. The design explores how colour theory and composition alone can convey meaning.

---

## 🔧 What I Focused On  
- Selecting a **harmonious or contrasting palette** to spark emotion  
- Using **shapes, gradients, and layering** to build visual flow  
- Balancing **negative space** to let colours breathe and interact  
- Letting **colour lead the composition** instead of content

---

## 📚 What I Learnt  
- That **colour psychology** plays a huge role in how visuals are felt  
- How **saturation, hue, and placement** affect the tone of a design  
- That abstract work needs **intentional structure** to avoid visual noise  
- Subtle **transparency and overlap** can add unexpected depth

## 🛠️ Tools & Features Used  
- Figma shapes, fill, and gradient tools  
- Layer blending modes for subtle transitions  
- Grid layout for controlled symmetry and spacing  
- Custom palette built from colour inspiration references
