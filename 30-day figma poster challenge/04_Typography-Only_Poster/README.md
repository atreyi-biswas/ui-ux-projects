## 🎯 Objective  
The goal was to design a powerful and clean poster using **only typography**, centered around the phrase **"Own who you are"**. No icons, images, or illustrations were used — just pure type to communicate message and tone.

---

## 🔧 What I Focused On  
- Giving the phrase strong **visual impact** to reflect confidence and authenticity.  
- Playing with **scale, weight, spacing**, and **placement** to build hierarchy and rhythm.  
- Creating emotional resonance through **minimal and bold** typographic choices.  
- Using **white space** strategically to guide focus and create balance.

---

## 📚 What I Learnt  
- How effective typography alone can convey both **emotion and structure**.  
- The importance of **type hierarchy** in drawing attention to key words.  
- How **subtle spacing changes** can shift the tone and feel of a layout.  
- That simplicity, when deliberate, can be **visually striking and communicative**.

## 🛠️ Tool Used  
- **Figma**

## 💡 Additional Notes  
- The phrase *"Own who you are"* inspired a tone of **self-empowerment**, which I reflected using bold, upright type and confident spacing.  
- Chose to work with a **limited palette and font selection** to keep the message undiluted.  
- Typography was used not just as text, but as the **main visual element** of the poster.
