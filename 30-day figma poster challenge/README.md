# 🎨 30-Day Figma-Only Poster Design Challenge

This is my personal challenge to level up my design skills using **Figma**. For the next 30 days, I’ll be creating one poster a day based on different themes. The goal is to improve my sense of layout, typography, color, and overall visual storytelling—while building consistency and a portfolio of creative work.

## 🛠 Tools I'm Using

- **Figma** (browser or desktop)
- **Google Fonts** (for type pairing)
- **Coolors.co** (for palette inspiration, when needed)

---

## 🔁 How I’m Doing It

- One poster a day for 30 days  
- No external design tools — just Figma  
- Each design takes about 30–60 minutes  
- I'm focusing on learning, not perfection  
- I’ll revisit my favorite pieces later to refine for my portfolio
