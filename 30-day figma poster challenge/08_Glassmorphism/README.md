## 🎯 Objective  
The goal of Day 8 in the 30-Day Figma Challenge was to explore and implement **Glassmorphism**, a design style that uses blurred transparency, layering, and subtle lighting to create a frosted-glass effect in UI components.

---

## 🔧 What I Focused On  
- Applying **background blur** and **semi-transparent fills** effectively to simulate the frosted glass look.  
- Maintaining **readability** and **contrast** across layers, especially in text-heavy sections.  
- Creating a clean, minimal layout that still felt layered and dimensional.  
- Using **shadows and borders** subtly to reinforce visual depth without overwhelming the design.

---

## 📚 What I Learnt  
- How to use Figma's **background blur effects** in combination with gradients for smoother transitions.  
- The importance of **layer hierarchy** and **foreground-background separation** in glassmorphic design.  
- How to keep UI functional and accessible while working with translucent elements.  
- Balancing aesthetic trends with **usability and readability**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Features Used  
- **Figma** – Layout, typography, and color styling
- **Youtube** - Learnt the concept
- **Google** - Images

## 💡 Additional Notes  
- While Glassmorphism is visually striking, it’s best used **sparingly** in real interfaces to avoid performance issues or legibility problems.  
- Accessibility remains key — light text on glassy backgrounds was tested for contrast using WCAG tools.  
- This was also a good opportunity to reinforce consistency in color palette and lighting direction.
