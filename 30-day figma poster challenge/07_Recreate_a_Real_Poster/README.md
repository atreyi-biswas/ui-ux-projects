## 🎯 Objective  
This poster was created as a motivational visual inspired by the iconic "You Can Do It!" campaign, aiming to energize and uplift viewers with bold typography and a powerful message.

## 🎨 Concept  
The concept was to modernize the classic Rosie the Riveter image with strong typographic emphasis on the phrase **“YOU CAN DO IT”**, reinforcing themes of empowerment, determination, and encouragement.  
- The background features a subtle gradient to modernize the feel.  
- Each word is emphasized in uppercase and bold fonts to command attention.  
- The design draws on historical inspiration while adding a fresh, digital aesthetic.

## 🔧 What I Focused On  
- **Typography:** Balancing readability with visual impact. Font weights and spacing were adjusted for hierarchy.
