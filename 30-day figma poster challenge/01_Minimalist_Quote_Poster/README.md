# 🎨 30-Day Poster Design Challenge – Day 1

## 🗓️ Date
June 1, 2025

## 🖼️ Prompt
**Minimalist Quote Poster**

## 📝 Description
Today's challenge focused on creating a minimalist poster emphasizing typography.  
The goal was to convey a strong message using clean design, plenty of white space, and a restrained color palette — highlighting the power of words when given room to breathe.

## 🧠 Inspiration
_"Change starts with you."_ – Judy Hopps, *Zootopia*

This quote guided the theme of today’s poster. It’s a powerful reminder that change begins at the individual level — a perfect message to represent through minimal typography. The design was built to let the quote speak clearly and confidently, with no distractions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Figma
- Pinterest (Colour Scheme)
- Image from Google

## ✨ Poster Text

## 🎨 Design Direction

### Typography
- **Font**: Clean, bold sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Montserrat, or Poppins)
- **Size**: Large headline for quote (~48–96 pt), smaller for attribution
- **Weight**: Bold for quote, Medium or Light for attribution
- **Alignment**: Centered for simplicity and strength

### Layout
- Center the quote vertically and horizontally
- Use generous white space
- Position the attribution subtly below the quote

### Color Palette
- **Option 1**: Black text on a white background (classic minimalist)
- **Option 2**: Pastel background (e.g., soft orange, sky blue) with white or dark text

## 🔍 Reflection
This exercise helped me explore how powerful typography can be when treated with intention.  
Minimal design puts every element under a spotlight — font, spacing, and alignment all matter. I learned that simplicity can make the message even more impactful.

## ✅ What I Learned
- Restraint leads to stronger communication.
- Typography is emotional — even with no images.
- Minimalism is not “less work”; it’s more thoughtful.

## 🚀 Next Steps
Tomorrow’s challenge will explore **color theory** by creating a poster that uses complementary colors to balance emotion and attention.
