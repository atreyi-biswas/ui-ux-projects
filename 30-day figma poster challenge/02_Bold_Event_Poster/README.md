## 🎯 Objective
The aim was to create a poster that instantly immerses the viewer in a magical world — something that feels like a portal to an unforgettable night of wonder, illusion, and spellbinding experiences.

## 🧠 Concept
The poster embodies the **“Magical”** theme through:
- How to use **gradients and shadows** to create depth and glow effects  
- How to build a **composition** that feels balanced and enchanting  
- How to pick **fantasy-inspired fonts** and blend them for impact  
- How to experiment with **components and constraints**, even for decorative elements  
- And most importantly — how to **think creatively with limitations** and still bring imagination to life

## ✅ What I Focused On
- Building a **dreamlike atmosphere** using glowing effects and layered backgrounds  
- Blending **readability with fantasy** through careful font selection and visual hierarchy  
- Using a **rich, magical color palette** (deep purples, silvers, gold accents)  
- Adding **illustrative details** like runes, stars, moons, and enchanted forests  
- Creating **visual flow and balance** so the viewer’s eye naturally moves across the design  
- Ensuring it is **print-ready and web-friendly**, adaptable to various display formats 
- Controling gradients and trying out figma features learnt.
